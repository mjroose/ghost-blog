School</a>'s community-powered code bootcamp.  The first project in the course is a command line interface (CLI) application built in Ruby using object-oriented programming principles.  For this project, I decided to build an application that scrapes Category and Recipe information from <a href="http://ketoconnect.net">Keto Connect</a>, a blog that shares recipes featured on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzRYivTpUQ0r2qPPjfLoQiA">Keto Connect YouTube channel</a>.  The source code for this project is available at <a href="https://github.com/mjroose/flatiron-keto-recipe-cli">my GitHub repository</a>.</p><h3 id="how-to-use-the-application">How to Use the Application</h3><p>To run the program, simply navigate to the project folder cloned from GitHub and type "ruby bin/recipe" in the command line.  The application will display a list of categories scraped, using Nokogiri, from the Keto Connect website.</p><figure

there, simply enter the recipe's number, and the recipe will be printed to the screen.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/10/fi-cli-caprese.png" class="kg-image"></figure><h3 id="how-i-built-the-application">How I Built the Application</h3><p>As I built the application, I decided to create three classes:  Category, KetoRecipe, and Menu.  A Category has a name, URL, and many recipes.  I created a Category class method to scrape all of the recipe categories from Keto Connect.  Each Category knows what recipes are in the category using the :recipes attribute.</p><p>An instance of the KetoRecipe class has a name, URL, category, and lists of ingredients and instructions.  The ingredients and instructions are stored as arrays.  This class has a class method to scrape the name and URL of each recipe in a Category, as well as an instance method to scrape the ingredients of and instructions for a single recipe.</p><p>I was torn as to where to place the class method to scrape all recipes from a single category.  I decided to place this functionality in KetoRecipe because the application does not need to know all recipes in all categories.  It only needs a list of recipes in a category once the user selects a category.  The benefit of only scraping a list of recipes in single a category are (1) there is less data to download, improving performance of the application, and (2) the application doesn't consume more of Keto Connect's bandwidth than necessary.</p><p>The last class is the Menu class.  Originally, the menu was in the Category class.  However, when I was writing the KetoRecipe class, I noticed that I would simply be copying and pasting the menu functionality.  Both the category menu and the recipe menu essentially display a numbered list and prompt the user to enter a number.  I decided to follow the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself), and created a generic menu class that could be used by both Category and KetoRecipe.</p><p>This project was interesting because I was able to practice two skills.  First, I gained more experience with Nokogiri, a web scraping tool.  Second, I designed and built a project from scratch.  While I've been coding off-and-on for some time in various languages, I haven't really created much using my skills.  This project was a great opportunity to practice thinking about how to design an application from beginning to end.  Also, I was able to use the Ruby skills that I've acquired through the Flatiron course.</p><p>For a demonstration of the project in action, see the video below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270"

 It runs on a <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> server and uses <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com">handlebars </a>for templates, which are two technologies that I'm familiar with.  I wasn't able to find a clear, up-to-date tutorial for deploying Ghost on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance.</p><p>It certainly would have been easier to use the hosting service that Ghost offers, but $29 per month is too high for my budget.  Also, Bitnami offers an option for subscribing to a service that preinstalls Ghost on an EC2 instance, but again, it costs too much for my budget ($0.067/hour * 24 hours * 30 days = $48.24/month).</p><p>Installing Ghost on an EC2 instance is actually quite simple.  The first step for me was to register my domain (michaelroose.com).  I used Amazon's Route 53 to register the domain, which cost $12.</p><p>Next, I deployed a new free-tier EC2 instance and opted to have Ubuntu preinstalled.  The reason I chose Ubuntu, as you will see below, is that Ghost's installation guide is based on Ubuntu.</p><p>After the EC2 instance was deployed, I created an Elastic IP under the Networking &amp; Security tab in the EC2 AWS console.  Once the Elastic IP was created, I selected Associate Address from the Actions drop-down menu.  I associated the new Elastic IP with the EC2 instance I deployed in the last step.</p><p>Technically, this step is optional.  An Elastic IP seems similar to a static IP address on a network because it never changes, as opposed to DHCP which could assign a new IP address every time you connect.  The benefit of an Elastic IP comes if you ever have to terminate your EC2 instance and create a new one.  The new instance will have a different IP address, but you can simply associate your Elastic IP with the new instance.  If you are not using an Elastic IP, you would have to modify your record set in Route 53, as explained below, to direct your domain to your new instance.</p><p>The next step is what I originally skipped, which caused me hours of frustration.  When an EC2 instance is deployed, it only permits inbound SSH traffic on port 22.  Therefore, inbound HTTP traffic on port 80 is blocked.  I had to open a port for HTTP traffic.</p><p>To open port 80, navigate to Security Groups under the Networking &amp; Security tab.  Select the security group that applies to your EC2 Instance (found under the Instances tab).  A dashboard appears below.  I selected the inbound tab, clicked Edit, and added a new rule.  I chose HTTP from the drop-down, which opens port 80 for HTTP requests.</p><p>From there, I moved back to Route 53 in the AWS console.  I selected Hosted Zones in the navigation pane and selected my new domain.  Then, I created two new record sets.  For the first record set I created, I left the subdomain (name) blank.  I selected "No" for Alias and pasted my Elastic IP address into Value.  I used the default settings for the remaining fields and saved my new record set.</p><p>For the second record set, I used the subdomain (name) "www".  I selected "Yes" for alias and entered my domain, "michaelroose.com", for the Alias Target.  I used the default settings for the remainder of the fields and saved the record set.</p><p>This completed the AWS setup.  The remainder of the setup was an easy task.  I just followed <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/docs/install">this guide</a>.  I only ran into two issues when following this guide.  First, "ghost install" failed because the user that I created did not own the "/home/[user]/.config" directory.  This issue can be fixed by running the following command:</p><p><code>sudo chown [user]:[user] /home/[user]/.config</code></p>
<p>The second issue is more a point of clarification.  For the most part, I used the default values when I ran "ghost install".  However, for the url, the default value of localhost:2368 did not work.  Once I used the url for my domain, http://michaelroose.com, when prompted for a url during the install I was able to open my new blog in the browser.</p><p>Installing Ghost on an EC2 instance was not too difficult.  By doing it myself, I learned more about EC2, routing, and AWS generally.  The best part is that by hosting my new blog on the free tier of EC2, I will save a lot of money each month.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
